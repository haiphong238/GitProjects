","longDesc":"Franz Liszt is one of the greatest composers of the 19th century. He toured through most of Europe as a travelling virtuoso, revolutionizing the concert genre with his performances. Crowds of eager fans would gather wherever he played. He was one of the most progressive composers of the Romantic era, alongside Wagner, bringing to life to such genres as the symphonic poem and revising such classic genres as the sonata and piano concerto. It’s impossible to imagine the music of the 20th century without him. \nAs a young man, he lived the high life but remained a devout catholic. In his old age he entered into a relationship with the church and was named an honorary abbot. Through his Christian faith and his strength of character, he remained selfless and devoted to his fellow man. This manifested itself, in part, in his devotion to teaching from a young age until his death, and in the last thirty years of his life all his performances were for charity. He was also a generous supporter of young talents. \nLiszt was born in the town of Doborján, formerly in western Hungary but now part of Austria. He lived for an extended period in Paris and toured as a performing artist for ten years before settling in Weimar. The last years of his life were spent in either Rome, Weimar or Budapest. \nHe considered himself a Hungarian and did a great deal for Hungary: during Hapsburg repression, his concerts often contained political messages, while in the more peaceful period of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, he worked on renewing musical culture, the most important result of this being the foundation of the Music Academy in 1875. \nThis walking tour, which begins at the heart of the city, will explore Liszt’s favorite locales and provide insight into everyday life in 19th century Budapest. From the Chain Bridge, to the Vigadó and the Dohány Street Synagogue, across Andrássy Boulevard to the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, and finally to what was once Liszt’s apartment but now houses the Liszt Ferenc Memorial Museum.

One or more masterpieces are selected in each major museum, church, or outdoor art space. If time is short, then you can just enjoy the works included in this tour. If you have more time, then consider this tour as a point of departure and feel free to browse other works on display around those listed here.

Lithuania played a significant role in the history of Europe during the Gediminaičiai dynasty, which began in the 13th-16th centuries. During the 15th and 16th centuries the Gediminaičiai took control of large areas of Central Europe: in addition to the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, covering today’s Belarus and most of Ukraine, they ruled Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and Prussia was dependent on them, too. The Russian state, where many descendants of the Gediminids live up to this day, played a significant role in a separate line of the tribe. Any number of current European heads of State almost certainly shares the bloodline due to old relations to the dynasty. A number of exceptionally beautiful architectural masterpieces were built in Kaunas under the reign of the dynasty, which are now popular tourist destinations.

Fast forward a few years and backpacks became replaced with strollers after the birth of her daughter and then her son, forcing her geophysics career to go into further hibernation. Her interest in travel and writing stumbled into a perfect union after her husband’s work brought the entire family over to live temporarily in Milan, Italy, giving birth to her blog, www.babiesandbruschetta.com.

Here are a handful of the best of the Oltrarno.\nCasalinga: great homemade, inexpensive dishes, without pretense\nBorgo Santo Spirito: a big favorite for in-the-know tourists, but it sure is good.  The famous thing to order is the giant plate of mixed shellfish, meant for two but generous enough for four.\nRifrullo: romantic and stylish for a drink or dinner out in the patio garden facing the medieval wall, this is the place for great steaks and more exotic twists on traditional Tuscan food.\nTrattoria Quattro Leoni: Anthony Hopkins ate here for every meal while filming Hannibal, and you can see why.

On one hand, you are not obliged to follow any pre-determined routes; you have the possibility to decide in which order you would like to visit each site. On the other hand, let’s not forget – this is a treasure hunt game as well! Keep a watchful eye out for Hungarian first names on the memorial plaques and inscriptions at the 15 sites marked on the map. Once revealed, the names have to be eliminated from a list of 16, finally marking and unmasking the true identity of the remaining person. The photos will also help your quest to find the names by showing the sites from a closer perspective. Naturally this treasure hunt is not merely about revealing the names.

The 1992 Olympics Games brought the opportunity to recover the waterfront, and transformed the old piers into stimulating public spaces that host leisure and cultural facilities. La Barceloneta, the traditional fisherman’s neighbourhood, was once again linked to urban life.

He toured through most of Europe as a travelling virtuoso, revolutionizing the concert genre with his performances. Crowds of eager fans would gather wherever he played. He was one of the most progressive composers of the Romantic era, alongside Wagner, bringing to life to such genres as the symphonic poem and revising such classic genres as the sonata and piano concerto. It’s impossible to imagine the music of the 20th century without him. \nAs a young man, he lived the high life but remained a devout catholic. In his old age he entered into a relationship with the church and was named an honorary abbot. Through his Christian faith and his strength of character, he remained selfless and devoted to his fellow man. This manifested itself, in part, in his devotion to teaching from a young age until his death, and in the last thirty years of his life all his performances were for charity. He was also a generous supporter of young talents. \nLiszt was born in the town of Doborján, formerly in western Hungary but now part of Austria. He lived for an extended period in Paris and toured as a performing artist for ten years before settling in Weimar. The last years of his life were spent in either Rome, Weimar or Budapest. \nHe considered himself a Hungarian and did a great deal for Hungary: during Hapsburg repression, his concerts often contained political messages, while in the more peaceful period of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, he worked on renewing musical culture, the most important result of this being the foundation of the Music Academy in 1875. \nThis walking tour, which begins at the heart of the city, will explore Liszt’s favorite locales and provide insight into everyday life in 19th century Budapest. From the Chain Bridge, to the Vigadó and the Dohány Street Synagogue, across Andrássy Boulevard to the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, and finally to what was once Liszt’s apartment but now houses the Liszt Ferenc Memorial Museum. It’s well worth taking the tour during the museum’s hours of operation from Monday-Friday 10am-6pm and Saturday 9am-5pm.\n\nStarting point: \nSzéchenyi István tér\n\nEnding point:\nLiszt Museum\n\nRest stops:\nRózsavölgyi Szalon (Szervita Square 5, open Monday to Saturday 10am-10pm), Párizsi Nagyáruház, Lotz Hall and Café (Andrássy Avenue 39, open Monday to Saturday 10am-10pm).\n\nFor those who would like to learn more about the connection between Budapest and Franz Liszt, more information is available in Ágnes Watzatka’s book Following Franz Liszt’s Footsteps in Budapest, published in several languages.","detail":"FULL","priceInCents":499,"cityId":1,"html":true,"recommended":false,"languages":["en","hu"],"images":["8183e3ec-4a34-488d-abe6-b597584ff428.jpg","d45c0471-ee95-461c-b507-b218201e99c2.jpg","9d762b79-9cec-43a2-b94d-12df59ee1001.jpg","8ee22bf8-1bfd-4d44-9330-a9aa401c326e.jpg","fed2513b-9f90-4076-b853-c625f1ddd71d.jpg","dd64bc7d-207e-4485-8e3c-7aec65e34f6c.jpg","0eaa6f0a-9311-4c9e-ae99-3edb91002132.jpg","62cd68d0-c362-4fb1-8115-b20ee106a0ee.jpg","59dbc2b2-ed29-4d70-a23e-4c5b1185e1f8.jpg"],"tourIds":[5832531],"lang":"en"},{"name":"\"I kiss your hands many times\"","id":"Budapest.t5832532","hidden":true,"tags":["Film, music and stories"],"purchaseItemId":713,"shortDesc":"A book tour by the author","longDesc":"A true story of one of the wealthiest families in Hungary.

This guided tour provides a sample of the very best art of Florence; from its world-renowned museums to its treasure-house churches and outdoor monuments. One could easily spend hours or even days wandering any one of Florence’s museums. But for those who would like expert advice and guidance on which works are worth the journey, then this is the only guide you’ll need.  \n\nThis tour is best done with a Firenze Card or another equivalent (such as an Amici degli Uffizi membership card), which allows you to skip lines and enter any museum in the city as often as you like.  Firenze Cards can be purchased throughout the city or in advance at www.firenzecard.it. This will give you the freedom to pop into museums that everyone else must either wait in line for or reserve weeks in advance.  Try not to act too smug! A note about using this guide: the GPS feature of this guide only works outdoors.  So when you arrive at a church or museum and enter you will have to locate the works of art featured in the guide on your own. \n\nStarting Point: the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, nicknamed the “Duomo”\n\nEnding Point:  the Accademia museum\n\nHighlights: the “Duomo,” the Accademia, the Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti, Museo del’Opere del Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, the Bargello, Brancacci Chapel, Ponte Vecchio, and the churches of Santa Felicita and Santa Maria Novella","detail":"FULL","priceInCents":499,"cityId":38,"html":false,"recommended":false,"languages":["en"],"images":["d50d2afa-22d1-451d-8ae0-92e76615730b.jpg","03dfe11a-a785-4f4a-a879-a8c41667e1df.jpg","c3827c2a-8d89-40a1-b147-95a7348fdec9.JPG","de5dca95-f635-46f5-938e-9cae264d65d1.jpg","08d356e9-532a-4050-88be-df5ebb2ff69d.JPG"],"tourIds":[2883537],"lang":"en"},{"name":"Hidden Gems of Florence","id":"Florance.t3604385","hidden":false,"tags":[],"purchaseItemId":484,"shortDesc":"Beyond the tour buses and cruises","longDesc":"Since the British included Florence on Grand Tours in the 18th century, it has been one of the most-visited cities in the world.

It can be tricky to find some room to breathe, particularly at the height of the tourist season, in the hot summer.  You should see the must-see highlights, of course (and if you can go in the offseason, it is recommended).  But there are other dimensions to Florence where only the in-the-know tourists go.  They are beyond the tour buses and cruises, and so visiting them allows time for quiet thought and appreciation.  They contain gems just as bright as those in the must-see art of Florence guide, but can be appreciated in a more calm manner.  Plus, when you get home you can tell your friends that you saw the real Florence, beyond the tourist top ten.\n\nStarting Point: Palazzo Medici-Riccardi\n\nEnding Point:  Tempio Maggiore (Great Synagogue)\n\nHighlights: Basilica di San Lorenzo, Chapel of the Princes, New Sacristy, Mercato San Lorenzo, Church of Santa Maria Novella, Palazzo Rucellai, Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, Mercato Nuovo, Casa Buonarroti, Tempio Maggiore (Great Synagogue), Palazzo Vecchio\n\nWhere to refuel: for the best pizza in Florence, go to Il Pizzaiolo; the Kosher Market, which has ingredients to buy but also some sit-down, informal booths where you can get staggeringly good meals for incredibly low prices.","detail":"FULL","priceInCents":499,"cityId":38,"html":false,"recommended":false,"languages":["en"],"images":["602caafc-b9fe-4840-af61-a03c9d45db1e.jpg","58f6aade-77ba-49bd-b6b7-eaa6fecc7015.jpg","e8ca084d-c025-4853-847c-f3049648c670.jpg","de33395c-8e82-485e-8a4e-3ae9915d0205.JPG","bb9a07f5-2cc6-4af8-b467-3f2f1c203254.JPG"],"tourIds":[3604385],"lang":"en"},{"name":"Florence Sightseeing Tours","id":"Florence","hidden":false,"tags":[],"purchaseItemId":477,"shortDesc":"The Birthplace of the Renaissance","longDesc":"Florence is just Florence.

It’s a neighborhood in which many visitors could imagine living, with its own restaurants and shops, and a sense that there are finally more locals than foreigners in this area, unlike the center across the river. Particularly in the evening, the Oltrarno (literally “across the Arno”) is delightful, a perfect place to make like the locals and have aperitivi or a nice meal under the stars. It also has its share of museums, churches, and sites, most of which are less crowded than those located on the north side of the river.\n\nStarting point: Ponte Vecchio\n\nEnding point: Museo Bardini\n\nHighlights: Ponte Vecchio, Santo Spirito, Giardino Torrigiani, La casa di Galileo Galilei, Forte del Belvedere, Museo Bardini, San Miniato al Monte, Piazzale Michelangelo, Palazzo Pitti\n\nWhere to refuel\nThere is no shortage of good restaurants in Florence, and those in the Oltrarno are likely to be quieter and less touristy than those elsewhere in the center.  Beware of any restaurant that advertises a “tourist menu”—Italian restaurants literally serve lower-quality food to tourists, because they assume that they won’t know the difference, and prepare better food at lower prices for those they consider might become regulars.  Your best bet is to choose a restaurant with a menu only in Italian, or at least one that does not seek to lure in unwary tourists.  Here are a handful of the best of the Oltrarno.\nCasalinga: great homemade, inexpensive dishes, without pretense\nBorgo Santo Spirito: a big favorite for in-the-know tourists, but it sure is good.  The famous thing to order is the giant plate of mixed shellfish, meant for two but generous enough for four.\nRifrullo: romantic and stylish for a drink or dinner out in the patio garden facing the medieval wall, this is the place for great steaks and more exotic twists on traditional Tuscan food.\nTrattoria Quattro Leoni: Anthony Hopkins ate here for every meal while filming Hannibal, and you can see why.

","longDesc":"ZSOLNAY PÉCS – from the start, these were the two words that Vilmos Zsolnay had emblazoned on his factory’s unique glazed ceramics.  The city’s name remained part of the emblem even when the Zsolnay logo changed.  His descendents continued the tradition, as did the factory’s owners afterward.\n\nZsolnay’s love of the city has always been returned by the citizens of Pécs, who remain proud of the factory and its remarkable ceramic work.\n\nZsolnay and Pécs were linked in more than name.  The Zsolnay family has enriched the city’s culture, fame and wealth over five consecutive generations.  Walking in the city today, we encounter the Zsolnay heritage at every turn: Facades of old buildings, or more recent ones, rooftops, statues, plaques and storefronts are adorned with examples of Zsolnay’s patented glazing process.\n\nOf course the works are also on display in the 55-year-old Zsolnay Museum – which details the factory’s history – as well as in the exhibits and on the historic buildings of the Zsolnay Cultural Quarter, which was built on the grounds of the former factory as part of the “Pécs 2010: European Capital of Culture” project.\n\nHighlights of our walk include: \nthe Zsolnay Museum, the former Savings Bank (today the County Hall), the Saracen Pharmacy (Sipőcz House), the Postal Palace, the Zsolnay statue, the Tüke fountain, the Hoffmann House, the National Theatre of Pécs, the Vasváry House, the Zsolnay Mausoleum, the Zsolnay Family and Factory History Exhibition, the Live Manufacture, the Pink Zsolnay Exhibition and the Gyugyi Collection.\n\nStarting point: \nZsolnay Museum\n\nEnd point: \nZsolnay Cultural Quarter\n\nIt is advisable to time your walk in accordance with the various opening hours.

SPACE en Pocketguide ontwikkelen hiervoor een interactieve app die op innovatieve wijze de geschiedenis van dit industriële erfgoed zichtbaar, hoorbaar en inleefbaar maakt met film- en audiofragmenten, foto’s en interviews met oud-medewerkers.","detail":"FULL","priceInCents":0,"cityId":112,"html":false,"recommended":false,"languages":["en","nl"],"images":["133109ee-a242-42f5-8280-e3f6dd8208fd.jpg","63501442-ba36-43fc-b5f5-a7a6983cb590.jpg"],"tourIds":[5013352],"lang":"en"},{"name":"Zürich Sightseeing Tours","id":"Zurich","hidden":false,"tags":[],"purchaseItemId":449,"shortDesc":"The City of Short Walks","longDesc":"Zürich is the largest city of Switzerland.
